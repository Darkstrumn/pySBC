Steel Battalions Controller Driver written in Python
Intended for a project using the Rpi as the controller.
The 7" touch screen as an MFD for a new updated control
experience.

Once the basic comms to the SBC are sorted out, then
further development of MFD visuals and such can be done.

Then the final bit is to make the client-server api functions
so a local client PC game\\program can be controlled.

Ultimate intended goal is to make the SBC a PC controller vi
Rpi being the heart of the controller. This is the pilot project
for this technique in controller interfece design I've done.

If the timing needs tobe more hi-rez, I may need to use something
other than Python, but presently it seems to be working! ^_^

End of line.
